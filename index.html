    <p align="justify">Data Science is a interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods,processes and algorithms,and systems to extract knowledge and gathering insights from data.It involves transforming raw data into actionable information and is used across various industries to solve problems, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.Data science is the study of data that helps us derive useful insight for business decision making. Data Science is all about using tools, techniques, and creativity to uncover insights hidden within data. It combines math, computer science, and domain expertise to tackle real-world challenges in a variety of fields. </p>

    <h2> Key aspects include <mark> data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and the application of machine learning techniques.</mark></h2>
    <h2><hr/>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><b>Data collection in data science is the process of systematically gathering and measuring information from various sources to answer research questions, solve problems, and inform decision-making. It's a crucial first step in any data science project, providing the raw material for analysis, modeling, and ultimately, deriving insights and predictions. </b></p>
    <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
    <p><b>Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing or scrubbing, is the process of identifying, correcting, and removing errors and inconsistencies from a dataset to improve its quality and reliability. It's a crucial step in data science, ensuring that data is accurate, complete, consistent, and usable for analysis, machine learning, or decision-making. 
Why is data cleaning important?
Improves data quality:
Data cleaning ensures that the data used for analysis is accurate, consistent, and reliable.</b> 
</p>
    <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
    <p><b>Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.</b></p>
    <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
    <p><b>Data visualization in data science is the practice of translating data into a visual context, like charts, graphs, or maps, to make it easier to understand and extract insights. It helps identify patterns, trends, and outliers in large datasets, enabling better analysis and faster decision-making. Essentially, it transforms complex information into a format that the human brain can more readily process and interpret. </b></p>
    <h2>ML Techniques</h2>
    <p><b>Machine learning (ML) techniques are essential in data science, enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming. These techniques fall under several categories, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Common algorithms used in data science include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and clustering methods. 
    <h2>What is the DataScience Process?</h2>
    <p><i>What is the data science process?
A business problem typically initiates the data science process. A data scientist will work with business stakeholders to understand what business needs. Once the problem has been defined, the data scientist may solve it using the OSEMN data science process:<br/>

O – Obtain data
Data can be pre-existing, newly acquired, or a data repository downloadable from the internet. Data scientists can extract data from internal or external databases, company CRM software, web server logs, social media or purchase it from trusted third-party sources.<br/>

S – Scrub data
Data scrubbing, or data cleaning, is the process of standardizing the data according to a predetermined format. It includes handling missing data, fixing data errors, and removing any data outliers.<br/>
E – Explore data
Data exploration is preliminary data analysis that is used for planning further data modeling strategies. Data scientists gain an initial understanding of the data using descriptive statistics and data visualization tools. Then they explore the data to identify interesting patterns that can be studied or actioned.<br/>

M – Model data
Software and machine learning algorithms are used to gain deeper insights, predict outcomes, and prescribe the best course of action. Machine learning techniques like association, classification, and clustering are applied to the training data set. The model might be tested against predetermined test data to assess result accuracy. The data model can be fine-tuned many times to improve result outcomes.<br/>

N – Interpret results
Data scientists work together with analysts and businesses to convert data insights into action. They make diagrams, graphs, and charts to represent trends and predictions. Data summarization helps stakeholders understand and implement results effectively.<br/>

<h2>Mathematical Notation</h2>
<p>
Superscripts are used to denote exponents eg.x<sup><mark>2</mark></sup> or powers, while subscripts can indicate indices, variables within a set, or specific elements of a vector or matrix. </p>    
<h2>Statistical Formula</h2>
<p>
Data science relies heavily on statistical analysis. Subscripts and superscripts are used to represent various statistical parameters, such as sample sizes n<sub><mark>i</mark></sub> in regression models.</p>
